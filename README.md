# project-owl-warrior

Hello, I constructed this site as part of my Girl Scout Gold Award Project to protect Eastern Screech Owls. 

The website consists of an article about Eastern Screech Owls and a 5-question quiz you can take to become an "Owl Warrior."

The goal of this site is to educate users of all ages on how to help owls in their community. I designed this site to be shared. 

Good luck programmers! I hope this site may be useful to you.
